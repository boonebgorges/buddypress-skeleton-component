	 * to begin its setup routine.
	 *
	 * BP_Component::start() takes three parameters:
	 *   (1) $id   - A unique identifier for the component. Letters, numbers, and underscores
	 *       only.
	 *   (2) $name - This is a translatable name for your component, which will be used in
	 *               various places through the BuddyPress admin screens to identify it.
	 *   (3) $path - The path to your plugin directory. Primarily, this is used by
	 *       BP_Component::includes(), to include your plugin's files. See loader.php
	 *       to see how BP_EXAMPLE_PLUGIN_DIR was defined.

	/**
	 * Include your component's files
	 *
	 * BP_Component has a method called includes(), which will automatically load your plugin's
	 * files, as long as they are properly named and arranged. BP_Component::includes() loops
	 * through the $includes array, defined below, and for each $file in the array, it tries
	 * to load files in the following locations:
	 *   (1) $this->path . '/' . $file - For example, if your $includes array is defined as
	 *           $includes = array( 'notifications.php', 'filters.php' );
	 *       BP_Component::includes() will try to load these files (assuming a typical WP
	 *       setup):
	 *           /wp-content/plugins/bp-example/notifications.php
	 *           /wp-content/plugins/bp-example/filters.php
	 *       Our includes function, listed below, uses a variation on this method, by specifying
	 *       the 'includes' directory in our $includes array.
	 *   (2) $this->path . '/bp-' . $this->id . '/' . $file - Assuming the same $includes array
	 *       as above, BP will look for the following files:
	 *           /wp-content/plugins/bp-example/bp-example/notifications.php
	 *           /wp-content/plugins/bp-example/bp-example/filters.php
	 *   (3) $this->path . '/bp-' . $this->id . '/' . 'bp-' . $this->id . '-' . $file . '.php' -
	 *       This is the format that BuddyPress core components use to load their files. Given
	 *       an $includes array like
	 *           $includes = array( 'notifications', 'filters' );
	 *       BP looks for files at:
	 *           /wp-content/plugins/bp-example/bp-example/bp-example-notifications.php
	 *           /wp-content/plugins/bp-example/bp-example/bp-example-filters.php
	 *
	 * If you'd prefer not to use any of these naming or organizational schemas, you are not
	 * required to use parent::includes(); your own includes() method can require the files
	 * manually. For example:
	 *    require( $this->path . '/includes/notifications.php' );
	 *    require( $this->path . '/includes/filters.php' );
	 *
	 * Notice that this method is called directly in $this->__construct(). While this step is
	 * not necessary for BuddyPress core components, plugins are loaded later, and thus their
	 * includes() method must be invoked manually.
	 *
	 * Our example component includes a fairly large number of files. Your component may not
	 * need to have versions of all of these files. What follows is a short description of
	 * what each file does; for more details, open the file itself and see its inline docs.
	 *   - -actions.php       - Functions hooked to bp_actions, mainly used to catch action
	 *              requests (save, delete, etc)
	 *   - -screens.php       - Functions hooked to bp_screens. These are the screen functions
	 *              responsible for the display of your plugin's content.
	 *   - -filters.php   - Functions that are hooked via apply_filters()
	 *   - -classes.php   - Your plugin's classes. Depending on how you organize your
	 *              plugin, this could mean: a database query class, a custom post
	 *              type data schema, and so forth
	 *   - -activity.php      - Functions related to the BP Activity Component. This is where
	 *              you put functions responsible for creating, deleting, and
	 *              modifying activity items related to your component
	 *   - -template.php      - Template tags. These are functions that are called from your
	 *              templates, or from your screen functions. If your plugin
	 *              contains its own version of the WordPress Loop (such as
	 *              bp_example_has_items()), those functions should go in this file.
	 *   - -functions.php     - Miscellaneous utility functions required by your component.
	 *   - -notifications.php - Functions related to email notification, as well as the
	 *              BuddyPress notifications that show up in the admin bar.
	 *   - -widgets.php       - If your plugin includes any sidebar widgets, define them in this
	 *              file.
	 *   - -buddybar.php      - Functions related to the BuddyBar.
	 *   - -adminbar.php      - Functions related to the WordPress Admin Bar.
	 *   - -cssjs.php     - Here is where you set up and enqueue your CSS and JS.
	 *   - -ajax.php      - Functions used in the process of AJAX requests.

	/**
	 * Set up your plugin's globals
	 *
	 * Use the parent::setup_globals() method to set up the key global data for your plugin:
	 *   - 'slug'           - This is the string used to create URLs when your component
	 *                adds navigation underneath profile URLs. For example,
	 *                in the URL http://testbp.com/members/boone/example, the
	 *                'example' portion of the URL is formed by the 'slug'.
	 *                Site admins can customize this value by defining
	 *                BP_EXAMPLE_SLUG in their wp-config.php or bp-custom.php
	 *                files.
	 *   - 'root_slug'      - This is the string used to create URLs when your component
	 *                adds navigation to the root of the site. In other words,
	 *                you only need to define root_slug if your component is a
	 *                "root component". Eg, in:
	 *                  http://testbp.com/example/test
	 *                'example' is a root slug. This should always be defined
	 *                in terms of $bp->pages; see the example below. Site admins
	 *                can customize this value by changing the permalink of the
	 *                corresponding WP page in the Dashboard. NOTE:
	 *                'root_slug' requires that 'has_directory' is true.
	 *   - 'has_directory'      - Set this to true if your component requires a top-level
	 *                directory, such as http://testbp.com/example. When
	 *                'has_directory' is true, BP will require that site admins
	 *                associate a WordPress page with your component. NOTE:
	 *                When 'has_directory' is true, you must also define your
	 *                component's 'root_slug'; see previous item. Defaults to
	 *                false.
	 *   - 'notification_callback'  - The name of the function that is used to format BP
	 *                admin bar notifications for your component.
	 *   - 'search_string'      - If your component is a root component (has_directory),
	 *                you can provide a custom string that will be used as the
	 *                default text in the directory search box.
	 *   - 'global_tables'      - If your component creates custom database tables, store
	 *                the names of the tables in a $global_tables array, so that
	 *                they are available to other BP functions.
	 *
	 * You can also use this function to put data directly into the $bp global.
